    "# Autoencoders, Variational Autoencoders and Conditional Varaiational Autoencoders\n",
    "\n",
    "Autoencoders (AEs) are neural networks designed for unsupervised learning, primarily used for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction. They consist of an encoder, which compresses input data into a lower-dimensional latent space, and a decoder, which reconstructs the original input from this compressed representation. Standard autoencoders can learn meaningful representations but often struggle with generating diverse, high-quality samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) improve upon AEs by introducing a probabilistic framework, ensuring that the learned latent space follows a structured distribution (typically Gaussian). Instead of mapping inputs to fixed points in the latent space, VAEs learn distributions, allowing for smooth interpolation and controlled sampling. This makes them powerful for generative tasks, as they can generate novel data points that resemble the training distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional Variational Autoencoders (cVAEs) extend VAEs by incorporating additional information, such as labels or descriptors, into the encoding and decoding process. This enables the generation of data conditioned on specific attributes, making cVAEs particularly useful in chemistry for designing molecules with desired properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "These models form the backbone of modern generative approaches in machine learning, with applications in molecular design, materials discovery, and reaction prediction.\n",

    "1. Unlike a naive AE that encodes an input data $x$ as a single point $z$ in the latent space, a VAE encodes it as a normal distribution $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma)$, and the latent representation $z$ is sampled from this distribution and then passed to the decoder;\n",

The loss function provides a straightforward answer: in addition to fitting the data by minimising the reconstruction error, it also drags the latent distribution to a standard normal distribution.

Also, because each input image is encoded as a Gaussian blob instead of a single point, the gaps in the latent space can be filled by such blurring so that meaningless decodings can be largely avoided.\n",

    "# Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "A **Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE)** is a type of generative model that extends the **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)** by incorporating **labels** during training and generation. This allows the model to generate specific outputs based on given labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our implementation, the CVAE is trained on the **MNIST dataset**, using digit labels to guide the latent space representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Structure\n",
    "The CVAE consists of three main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Encoder\n",
    "The encoder maps an input image $x$ and its corresponding **one-hot encoded label** $ y $ into a latent space:\n",
    "- The input image $x $ (flattened 28×28 pixels) is concatenated with the label $y$.\n",
    "- This combined input is passed through a fully connected **encoder network**.\n",
    "- The network produces **mean** $\\mu$ and **log variance** $\\log \\\\sigma^2$for the latent representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Latent Space Sampling (Reparameterization Trick)\n",
    "To enable backpropagation, the model uses the **reparameterization trick**:\n",
    "$\n",
    "z = \\mu + \\sigma \\cdot \\epsilon, \\quad \\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, I)\n",
    "$\n",
    "where $z$ is a sampled latent vector that represents the compressed information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Decoder\n",
    "The decoder reconstructs the image using the sampled latent vector $z$ and the label $y$:\n",
    "- The latent vector $z$ is concatenated with the label $y$.\n",
    "- This combined input is passed through a **decoder network**.\n",
    "- The network outputs a **reconstructed image**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loss Function\n",
    "The CVAE is trained using a combination of two loss terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reconstruction Loss**: Measures how accurately the reconstructed image resembles the original.\n",
    "$\n",
    "   \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{recon}} = \\sum x \\log(\\hat{x}) + (1 - x) \\log(1 - \\hat{x})\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **KL Divergence Loss**: Encourages the learned latent distribution to be close to a normal distribution.\n",
    "$\n",
    "   \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{KL}} = -\\frac{1}{2} \\sum (1 + \\log \\sigma^2 - \\mu^2 - \\sigma^2)\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "The total loss is:\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\mathcal{L} = \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{recon}} + \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{KL}}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Model Definition (`CVAE`)\n",
    "- `encode(x, y)`: Encodes the input and label into latent space (produces $\\mu$ and $\\log \\sigma^2$).\n",
    "- `reparameterize(mu, logvar)`: Samples from the latent space.\n",
    "- `decode(z, y)`: Reconstructs the image from the latent vector and label.\n",
    "- `forward(x, y)`: Full forward pass through encoder, reparameterization, and decoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Training (`train_cvae`)\n",
    "- Uses **Adam optimizer** to minimize the total loss.\n",
    "- Runs for multiple epochs, updating weights via backpropagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Conditional Image Generation (`generate_from_prompt`)\n",
    "- Allows users to generate images by specifying a digit.\n",
    "- Uses a random latent vector combined with a one-hot encoded label.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "- The **CVAE** can generate **conditional outputs**, making it more powerful than a standard VAE.\n",
    "- The **latent space visualization** helps understand how different digits are encoded.\n",
    "- The **generation function** allows creating specific digits on demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation provides a flexible way to explore generative modeling using deep learning. 🚀\n"
